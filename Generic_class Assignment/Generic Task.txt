Generic Tasks:

1. Create a generic class called Pair that has two properties of type T: First and Second. The class should have a constructor that accepts two arguments, 
which are used to initialize the properties. Then, create an instance of the class with the types string and int and print the values of the First and Second 
properties to the console.

2. Write a generic method called Swap that takes two references to objects of type T and swaps their values. For example, if you call Swap with two int variables, 
their values should be swapped. Then, create two variables of type string and swap their values using the Swap method.

3. Create a generic class called Stack that implements a stack data structure. The class should have a generic type parameter T, and it should support the following 
methods: Push, Pop, and Peek.
